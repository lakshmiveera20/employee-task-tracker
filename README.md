This project is a simple Employee Task Tracker built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays employees, their tasks, task statuses, and provides options to search, filter, and add new tasks. The interface is designed in a dashboard style with a clean modern layout. All data is stored using LocalStorage, so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

Project Setup Instructions (Simple Paragraph):-

No additional setup, installation, or server is needed because everything is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. Once opened, the dashboard loads automatically and shows the employees, tasks, and all features.

Assumptions Made

Since a backend or API was not required, all employee and task data is stored in LocalStorage.
Initial sample employee data is predefined inside the script.
The project is meant to be simple and focused on UI and basic JS functionality.
Search works for both employee names and task titles.
Filtering is based on task status (All, Pending, In Progress, Completed).
